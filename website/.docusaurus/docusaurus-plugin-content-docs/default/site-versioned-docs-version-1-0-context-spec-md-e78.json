  "description": "To interoperate, apps need to exchange commonly recognized context structures that can indicate topic with any number of identifiers or mappings to different systems. FDC3 Context Data defines a standard for passing common identifiers and data between apps to create a seamless workflow. FDC3 Context Data is not a symbology solution and is not specifically focused on modeling financial objects. The focus is on providing a standard payload structure that can be used to establish a lowest common denominator for interoperability.",
