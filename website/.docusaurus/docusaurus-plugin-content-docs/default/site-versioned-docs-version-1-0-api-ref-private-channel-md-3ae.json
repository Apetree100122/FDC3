  "description": "Object representing a private context channel, which is intended to support secure communication between applications, and extends the Channel interface with event handlers which provide information on the connection state of both parties, ensuring that desktop agents do not need to queue or retain messages that are broadcast before a context listener is added and that applications are able to stop broadcasting messages when the other party has disconnected.",
